Todo add documentation
Todo make example interfaces that show the capability of the project
Todo test the capability of the project
Todo add more controllers and polish existing ones and fill the unfinished ones
Todo make more collections in different levels of complexity (List, Form, ContextMenuForm etc)
Todo clean the different types of type (i.e. te, tc, td, ti, tf)
Todo add coverage for different selectors (i.e. (x: webdriver) => WebElementPromise[], (x: WebElementPromise) => WebElementPromise, (x: WebElementPromise) => WebElementPromise[])
Todo add a type property to all controllers and collections parameters so that there could be two of them that take the same parameters and have different functionality
Todo use previous todo to allow for singular property (not in a list) by building according to type
Todo add an optional property to the parameters of each buildable that controllers weather it builds lazily or not
Todo add coverage for button that can have a few states
Todo cover cases were there is a need to aggregate one type with another (for example in case where form parent extends a complex collection and the child form only needs to add a few simple members)
Todo make it such that everywhere there is a collection of simples there is actually only one simple collection (remove the lists of simple collections and cover it by extending simple collection and solve the have to have something in the list problem)
